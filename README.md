# Skin-Lesion-Analyzer
Skin cancers are the most common forms of human malignancies in fair skinned populations. Although malignant melanoma is the form of skin cancer" with the highest mortality, the non-melanoma skin cancers" (basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, etc.) are far more common. The incidence of both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers is increasing, with the number of cases being diagnosed doubling approximately every 15 years. In this manner, early finding of skin cancer can diminish mortality and dreariness of patients. In this paper we are investigating various techniques for early stage melanoma skin cancer detection. The objective of this project is to tell doctors and lab technologists the three highest probability diagnosis for a given skin lesion using a machine learning model that is trained using a public dataset ‘HAM10000’ provided by Harvard which consists of 10,015 dermatoscopic images which are released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and are publicly available through the ISIC archive. This benchmark dataset can be used for machine learning and for comparisons with human experts.
